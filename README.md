## üòä About Me

Hi! I'm Merlin Schumacher, a Senior Software Developer with a passion for building software that not only works but works for people. From code to communication, I aim to make complex things simple and powerful. My unique background ‚Äî ranging from a degree in Cultural Studies with a major in Popular Culture, Media, and Arts to a past career as an IT journalist at Heise and c't magazine ‚Äî helps me communicate complex ideas across teams and to customers.  
With years of experience in both coding and communication, I have a distinct skill set that enables me to broker between developers, managers, and clients to bring innovative ideas to life.

Currently, I work at [holistic-net](https://github.com/holistic-net), where I lead teams in creating bespoke B2B software solutions as well as commercial products. We're focusing on delivering robust systems that streamline operations and meet specific business needs.

Outside of work, I'm interested in pop culture and the arts. I like experimenting with IoT and self-hosting in my free time.
Whether I‚Äôm building a custom IoT project or diving into the latest trends in pop culture, I enjoy exploring how technology influences our everyday lives
